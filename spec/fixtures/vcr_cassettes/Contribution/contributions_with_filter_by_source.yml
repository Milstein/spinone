        Higher Education (THE), the most respected compiler of the rankings of the
        universities in the world, recently published the ranking of the best universities
        in the world. In the rankings of 2013/2014, the University of Tartu is continuously
        the only university from the Baltic States, which is among 3% of the best
        universities in the world. In recent years, the scientists in UT (lead by
        the Natural History Museum) have showed interest in publishing research data.
        Since UT has joint projects with the Estonian University of Life Sciences,
        the Tallinn Technological University, the Tallinn University and other Estonian
        research institutions, DataCite Estonia is available for all scientists and
        research institutions in Estonia. DataCite Estonia is funded by the Estonian
        Research Council. DataCite Estonia platform is coordinated by the University
        of Tartu Library, a leading research library in Estonia and the first library
        openly promoting Open Access from 2009. The University of Tartu Library is
        now also taking the lead into promoting Open Data movement as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n","member-type":"allocating","region":"EMEA","country":"Estonia","year":2014,"logo-url":"https://assets.datacite.org/images/members/estdoi.png","email":"liisi.lembinen@ut.ee","website":"http://www.ut.ee/en","phone":"+372

        International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resource for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA)
        focuses on the exchange of seeds and other building blocks of the genetic
        diversity of the world’s food crops, stimulating research that is essential
        to the development of climate-smart agriculture and, therefore, also to food
        security.  In a world where most countries depend strongly upon crops originating
        elsewhere, the Treaty facilitates the exchange and conservation of crop genetic
        resources amongst member nations, as well as the fair sharing of benefits
        arising from their use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Treaty, hosted at
        the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Rome, has created
        a global genepool for food security under the direct control of all Contracting
        Parties with several million samples of plant genetic material that facilitate
        research for major important crops such as maize, rice, wheat and cassava,
        among others. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Treaty has also set up a
        Global Information System to facilitate the exchange of information, based
        on existing systems, on scientific, technical and environmental matters related
        to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. The participation of
        the Treaty in the DataCite consortium enables this System to allocate DOIs
        to plant genetic material for the benefit of farmers, researchers, genebanks
        and the entire plant genetic resources community.\u003c/p\u003e\n","member-type":"allocating","region":"EMEA","country":"Italy","year":2015,"logo-url":"https://assets.datacite.org/images/members/ITPGRFA.png","email":"pgrfa-treaty@fao.org","website":"http://www.planttreaty.org","phone":"+39
