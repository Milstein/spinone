        is a founding member of DataCite and a regional office for the Netherlands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTU
        Delft Library has established DataCite Netherlands to serve as a central research
        dataset registration service that will enable Dutch research organizations
        to register research datasets and assign digital object identifiers (DOIs)
        to them. Our aim is to support researchers by improving access to research
        data and to increase acceptance of the research data as legitimate, citable
        contributions to scientific record through trustworthy registration and identification
        of datasets. The current focus of DataCite Netherlands is on promoting the
        use of digital object identifiers for datasets.\u003c/p\u003e\n","member-type":"allocating","region":"EMEA","country":"Netherlands","year":2009,"logo-url":"https://assets.test.datacite.org/images/members/delft.png","email":"library@tudelft.nl","website":"http://www.library.tudelft.nl/en","phone":"+31
