        intoxication related to pesticides exposure. A questionnaire was dedicated
        to a sample of 412 workers. An analysis of non-conditional logistic regression

        significant variables in the final model. Of the analysed population, 59.2%
        reported symptoms typical of subacute intoxication. Of the respondents, 91.5%
        reported knowing the deleterious effects associated with exposure to pesticides.

        were two components in this study: component I- the prevalence of HPV infection;
        and component II - HPV risk assessment. Component I included study sites in
        the Northwest Territories (NT), Nunavut (NU), and Labrador region (LB). Component
        II included study sites in NT and Yukon (YT).\n\nIn component I, bio-sample
        collection for HPV testing was incorporated into routine Pap testing and no
        extra samples were required. All bio-samples were collected by physicians
        or nurses and sent to relevant Public Health Laboratories for Pap testing.
        Approximately half of each sample was used for a Pap test, and the remainder
        was shipped to the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg for
        HPV typing using the Luminex assay method. Pap test results, HPV types, and
        demographic information were linked for analysis. 5726 samples were collected
        in NT between April, 2008 and March, 2009; 4683 samples were collected in
        NU between January, 2008 and March, 2009; and 1363 samples were collected
        in the Labrador region between January, 2010 and November, 2010.\n\nComponent
        II used the same method for data collection as component I, with the addition
        that women were asked to answer a questionnaire to provide their risk factor
        information. Pap test results, HPV types, demographic information and questionnaire
        data were linked for analysis. 1279 samples were collected in NT, between
        April, 2009 and March, 2010; and 1621 samples were collected in YT between
        February, 2009 and June, 2010.","Purpose: Cervical cancer rates are higher
        among aboriginal populations in Canada. Certain types of the Human Papillomavirus
        (HPV) are sexually transmitted and highly associated with the development
        of cervical dysplasia (pre-cancerous condition) and cervical cancer, but their
        distribution in northern populations is largely unknown. The purposes of this
        project are to identify the prevalence of type-specific HPV infection and
        cervical dysplasia, and to determine the impacts of social, demographic, and
        behavioural factors on HPV infection among women in northern Canada to establish
        more effective programs for cervical cancer prevention and control.","Summary:
        Human Papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a group of more than 100 related viruses
        and can be highly associated with the development of cervical cancer. Aboriginal
        women have a higher risk of developing cervical cancer, yet there is limited
        information about HPV infection in Northern Canada. To fill this gap in knowledge,
        this project is examining HPV infection and cervical dysplasia (precancerous
        cells) in women of the Northwest Territories, Yukon and Nunavut to determine
        general prevalence rates, types of HPV, and risks associated with the development
        of HPV. The aim is to provide scientific evidence for policy makers and local
        public health workers to assist in the planning and implementation of cancer
        control programs."],"title":["The prevalence of Human Papillomavirus and its

        of Economy and Competitiveness through the Secretary of State for Research,
        Development and Innovation, its main objective is to develop and promote research
        that will help bring about scientific and technological progress, and it is
        prepared to collaborate with Spanish and foreign entities in order to achieve

        to advancing knowledge and economic, social and cultural development, as well
        as to train staff and advise public and private entities on this matter. CSIC
        plays an important role in scientific and technological policy, since it encompasses
        an area that takes in everything from basic research to the transfer of knowledge
        to the productive sector. Its research is driven by its institutes, which

        of whom more than 3,000 are staff researchers and the same number again are

        20% of all scientific production in the country. It also manages a range of
