title: DataCite REST API
description: A common API to get all metadata from DataCite.
---

The DataCite REST API allows users to retrieve, query and browse DataCite DOI metadata records.
The API is generally RESTFUL and returns results in JSON, and the API follows the [JSONAPI](http://jsonapi.org/) specification. The DataCite REST API is not intended for creating DOIs or metadata records, please use the Metadata Store ([MDS](https://mds.datacite.org)) API. This DataCite REST API does NOT requires authentication.

You will find more information about the REST API in our [documentation portal](https://support.datacite.org/docs/api).
